def lebedev_laikov_grid_over_hemisphere(grid_number: int, precision) -> ndarray:
    """
    Returns Lebedev-Laikov-Grids [1] over a hemisphere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_number : int
        An integer from 0 to 11 controling the number of points in the grid
        over the hemisphere.

        0 - 17 points,
        1 - 29 points,
        2 - 93 points,
        3 - 161 points,
        4 - 185 points,
        5 - 229 points,
        6 - 309 points,
        7 - 401 points,
        8 - 505 points,
        9 - 889 points,
        10 - 1381 points,
        11 - 2949 points

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Grid array in the form [[direction_x, direction_y, direction_z,
        weight], ...].

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If grid is not an integer from 0 to 11.

    Notes
    -----
    Grids 0-2 can be considered as insufficient in most cases (only should be
    used for experimental purposes), 3-5 minimal to standard, 6-8 very precise,
    but costly, 9-11 very dense - only for particular use-cases (extremely
    costly - especially 10-11).
